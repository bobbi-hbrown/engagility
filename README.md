This project is the prototype of an accessible dashboard, comprised of a ‘current incidents’ dataset from datamillnorth.org and recent Twitter data (last 7 days). It will include a text-to-speech feature, written summary of results, and a map-based visualisation of tweet locations. The purpose of this dashboard is to illustrate the real-world consequences of water quality issues, and provide a near real-time data source which can be used proactively.
